When I was 15yo, I was publishing yugioh card templates for photoshop in Deviantart. Making cards was a hobby for me because I could print them and play. But all those editing was not worth the time, I had no other choice though. Always wanted to make a faster solution, but I couldn't.
At the time of writing (Aug, 2020), it is 6 months that I've started web development. I came back to the idea of making a faster solution for making yugioh cards. Started making this site all alone, watched a lot of tutorials, spent a lot of time searching the web, and I finally made this. IT IS WORKING BLAZING FAST! Not to forget, I wanna mention that making cards are not only for print and play, but also for any request for digital proxies, like ygopro game, or anything simmilar.

I hope you enjoy this website! Regards & love ðŸ˜ƒðŸ’–,
